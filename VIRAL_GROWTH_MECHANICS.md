    };
    ongoing: {
      networkBonus: 'permanent +10% discovery rate per active referral';
      exclusiveContent: 'referral-only tournaments';
      statusUpgrade: 'Mentor badge after 5 successful referrals';
    };
  };
  referee: {
    immediate: {
      starterBonus: 'premium pet species selection';
      acceleratedProgress: '3x experience for first week';
      exclusiveContent: 'friend-referred user tournament';
    };
    guided: {
      mentorship: 'paired with referrer for guidance';
      groupChallenges: 'immediate access to friend challenges';
      network: 'introduced to referrer friend network';
    };
  };
  ecosystem: {
    networkEffects: 'improved matchmaking for everyone';
    contentQuality: 'more diverse wine discoveries';

  };
}
```

### Milestone-Based Referral Rewards

## 10. Viral Measurement Framework

### Key Viral Metrics to Track

#### Primary Viral Coefficient Metrics
```typescript
interface ViralMetrics {
  kFactor: {
    calculation: 'invites_sent * conversion_rate';
    target: 1.5; // Sustainable growth
    measurement: 'weekly cohorts';
  };
  viralCycleTime: {
    definition: 'time from invitation to new user generating invitations';
    target: '7-14 days';
    factors: ['onboarding flow', 'friend challenge timing', 'achievement unlock pace'];
  };
  networkValueMultiplier: {
    calculation: 'engagement_with_friends / engagement_solo';
    target: 2.5; // Strong network effects
    measurement: 'monthly active users';
  };
}
```

#### Secondary Engagement Metrics
```typescript
interface EngagementMetrics {
  shareRates: {
    evolutionShares: 'percentage of evolutions shared';
    achievementShares: 'percentage of achievements shared';
    battleHighlights: 'percentage of victories shared';
    discoveryShares: 'percentage of rare discoveries shared';
  };
  challengeParticipation: {
    friendChallenges: 'percentage participating in friend challenges';
    guildActivity: 'active guild member percentage';
    tournamentEntry: 'eligible users entering tournaments';
  };
  networkGrowth: {
    friendAcceptanceRate: 'friend request acceptance rate';
    guildJoinRate: 'guild invitation acceptance rate';
    referralActivation: 'percentage of referred users becoming active';
  };
}
```

### A/B Testing Framework

1. **Referral Mechanism Testing**:
   - Reward timing (immediate vs delayed)
   - Reward type (game benefits vs exclusive content)
   - Invitation messaging and calls-to-action

2. **Social Feature Optimization**:

   - Guild size and structure optimization
   - Tournament bracket size and format

3. **Content Sharing Optimization**:

   - Content format and visual design
   - Social proof messaging effectiveness

### Analytics Implementation
```typescript
interface ViralAnalytics {
  events: {
    referralSent: { source: 'evolution' | 'achievement' | 'battle' | 'manual' };
    referralConverted: { timeToConversion: number, firstAction: string };
    challengeCreated: { challengeType: string, participantCount: number };
    shareGenerated: { contentType: string, platform: string, engagement: number };
  };
  cohortAnalysis: {
    referralCohorts: 'track performance by referral source';
    networkSizeCohorts: 'segment users by network size';
    engagementCohorts: 'track retention by viral participation';
  };
}
```
